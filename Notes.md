    *  John Mitch - Barry

  * packages - scope reduction - open sourced / outsourced / orchestrated
 
  * microservices
    * conways law
    * problems / tooling 
    * risk - innovation - heterogeneous
    * evolution - Barrak Obarma
    * modularity - testing types A/B

    * testing in production
    * the rise and rise of monitoring
    * meta-level WFH Covid - services - plug in 
  * devops 
  * devops culture

  * the strongly typed functional paradigm 
    * more later - more powerful compiler - risk elimination

Key Principles
    * risk elimination
    * decrease impact
    * decrease scope
    * time compression
    * decrease contexualise risk

Future
    * there is still going to be manual testing but less
    * there will still be automation but less
    * high risk domains
    * laggards large complex domain specific systems
      * more effective manual testing
      * different types of testing
      * manual testers -> domain experts
    * more effective automation 
    * better integration between automation

Why Frameworks
  * Consistent
  * Reusable
  * Concrete Implementation of an Opinionated Solution
  * Most importantly It Eliminates Choice - Constraints Liberate, Liberties Constrain â€” Runar Bjarnason

Automation Framework Principles 
  * How is end to end automation different to unit testing 
    * application stack
    * people stack
      * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0tpjs8zflQ
    * type 2 errors
    * logging reporting
    * magnitudes slower
    * will be worked on by lower skilled devs
    * 
  * its not a unit test
  * it will always be wrong - refactor early, hard and often
  * semantic layers
    * test layer    - Tests
    * domain layer  - Helpers
    * utils layer   - Domain Independent Functions (time, web interactions, REST calls)
    * further specific layering 
      * Browser / Appium Based
        * read
        * write
        * navigate
        * seek and set functions
        * setForm
        * auto-generate set form
        * cache session
      * REST Based
        * specific seek and set functions JSON 
  * execution separated into layers 
    * data generation                     - pure
    * aut interaction                     - impure
    * parsing aut data -> domain object   - pure
    * validation of domain object         - pure
  * highly focussed on data driven testing
    * object lists
    * generative testing
  * multiple asserts in one test
  * big emphasis on logging reporting
  * utilise existing packages and libraries such as Selenium / Appium / C# rest ?? 
  * heavy use of types and functional programming concepts
  * must be OSS

2 Projects
  * DRY
    * I'm a hypocrite
    * I can see a day coming when it will be feasable 
    * pick and stick
    * paradigm and language which:
      * has a type system which eliminates a huge amount of risk
      * separates purity from state
      * highly expressive  
      * is highly re-factorable
      * paradigm is functional programming and the language is the canonical FP language which is haskell 

What is FP
  * history
    * Alonzo Church 
    * Alan Turing
  * Simon Peyton Jones - describes Functional programming
  * https://youtu.be/zLMN34DB5Ms?t=200
  * higher order functions
  * declarative statelessness is pervasive
    * Devops - gitops
    * Dhall
    * Nix
  * split languages
    * C#
  * other languages
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_cUNM0H8QU&t=21s
  * Haskell moving

What is Haskell - Why Haskell
  * history
  * no variables
  * no loops
  * only values and functions
  * functions can only take one parameter
  * higher kinded types
  * parse don't validate
  * pattern matching
  * pioneered property based testing

Problem with haskell
  * overwhelming 
  * thesisware
  * language extensions
